* openHAB on NixOS

This is an *extremely* basic flake for running openHAB on NixOS.

* Does it work

1. run =make vm=
2. wait for a while
3. open http://localhost:8080 in a browser

This is currently just bringing up openHAB - you can't really do anything with it other than going through the GUI, but we now have a team on this after the nixcon 2023 hackday, so now things are moving.

We cannot recommend doing anything with this until https://github.com/peterhoeg/openhab-flake/milestone/1 is released.
